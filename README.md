# Hubitat Physical Light Control
A hubitat app for easily setting up buttons to control a group of lights

Initial this was just a port of my Smartthings app here: https://github.com/eliotstocker/SmartThings-LightPhysicalControl

It has now morphed into a much more well rounded app

## What Can It Do?
* Quick Setup
* Controls Brightness, Color Temperature and Color
* Can disable different Lights at different Times of day (when the on button is pressed) - For instance I like to have all of the lights on including the Ceiling Light during the day, but Turn it off at night and only have the up lighters on.
* Dim and Brighten by holding buttons (on controllers with 4 or more buttons)
* Set up a "scene" to run when quick pressing Dim or Brighten Buttons
* Snapshot current lighting conditions for either Top level settings or Timed Settings - This is great! ask google setset some lights to specific brightness, set some colours, turn off the over head light, make sure its all haw you like it and then snapshot that for your evening "scene"

## So How Does it Work?
To get yourself up and Running you simply select a push button device to control the lights and the light devices you wish to control.

at this point you now have a simple switch, from here the possibilities are endless!
Set your top level settings with a nice default.
Next setup some "scenes" for when turning the lights on in the evening (try telling google or alexa how you want your lights and then using the snapshot feature)
Next (on a 4 or more button controller) set some button overrides to (for instance) always jump to full brightness when quick pressing the brighten button.
