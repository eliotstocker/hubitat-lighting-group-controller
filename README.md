# Hubitat Physical Light Control
A hubitat app for easily setting up physical buttons to control a group of lightd

This is a full port of my Smartthings app here: https://github.com/eliotstocker/SmartThings-LightPhysicalControl

It allows for setting a button device to control a group of lights, (turn on/off set color, and or color temperature and/or brightness)
You can then also set different modes when buttons are pressed at different times of the day (including turning some off in the evening for instance)
